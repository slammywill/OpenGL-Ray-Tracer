## About 
This project was done for COSC363 (Computer Graphics), in assignment 2. This uses the OpenGL to render the final image, which is composed of the output of a ray traced scene. This implementation includes a range of features, such as:
- Mulitple reflections using parallel mirrors
- A refractive sphere
- Fog
- Antialiasing
- Procedural patterns
- Stochastic (soft) shadows
- Depth of field
