## About 
This project was done for COSC363 (Computer Graphics), in assignment 1. This uses the OpenGL fixed function pipeline to create a scene of an alien walking around a UFO. The implementation includes features such as:
- Planar shadows
- Spotlights on a moving object
- A sky dome
- A custom built surface of revolution
- Spaceship liftoff
